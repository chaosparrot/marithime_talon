# Memorization performance ( speed + errors )

In order to better understand what kinds of words are easier to remember, I have made lists of 12 words that I needed to remember a day after compiling them in order to test my long term memory. The performance is given in time and accuracy. 

Seven lists were made for different types, combinations and sorting of words. No context is given at the start of the list, only the title of the list ( verb, context noun ) and a recording is made of me reciting the commands that I remembered within a single minute time frame. Performance is measured in amount of commands remembered and misremembered, and a list of seconds in between commands.

## Method

The first recording was made right after compiling the lists, so some short term memory effect still lingers. Rehearsing was done after the first recording by saying the lists out loud 3 times. The second recording was made the next day in the morning.

## Data

The recorded WAV files were analyzed using Audacity. All times are given in seconds.
Time before phrase refers to the starting time in the file.
Time between last phrase refers to the time since the end of the uttering of the last word.
Time between words refers to any time or delay that has occurred between the command.

# Results

During the first 15 seconds, users make about 59% (σ 13.9) of the attempts, with an average error rate of 13.7% (σ 13.9). After 30 seconds, 25% (σ 8.5) of attempts are made an average error rate of 69.5% (σ 25.2) is observed.

There is no significant retention rate between single words (64.8% σ 21.2) compared to combinations of words (61.1% σ 17.8). Verb starts have a retention rate of 48.8% (σ 21.7), whereas noun starts have a retention rate of 71.5% (σ 13). Using context nouns in any order, the retention rate becomes 80.2% (σ 7.8). The retention of the beginning of combination words however is much better (100% σ 0) than any other word, and no difference between verbs or nouns has been observed. 

No significant difference in error rate can be observed in perceived retention rates when they are low ( when no context nouns are used, 30.2% σ 15.2) versus when the retention rate is perceived high (30.2% σ 10.5). However, the user does make more attempts for high perceived retention rate (14.3 σ 1.5) versus the low perceived retention rate (9.2 σ 1.5).

The average time between commands is heavily skewed by commands that are forgotten, but for commands with low perceived retention rates it is 5 seconds (σ 1.4) , whereas it is 3.3 seconds (σ 0.5) for commands with high perceived retention rates. If we remove the outliers ( 10+ seconds between commands being considered forgotten), we get an average of 2.2 seconds (σ 1) for low perceived retention rates and an average of 1.6 seconds (σ 0.5) for high retention rates. Comparing single words to combination words without outliers, we get an average of 2.2 seconds (σ 1) for single words, and 1.7 seconds (σ 0.8) for combination words. Comparing verb starts versus noun starts without outliers, we get 2.4 seconds (σ 0.8) for verb starts, and 2.1 (σ 1.9) for noun starts, which isn't a significant difference speed wise.

Errors took up 30% ( 49 utterances ) of the in total 159 occurrences made. Incorrect guesses take up 87% of all the made errors, where 30% of these errors are made because a word from another list is used confidently. Mistakes that have been made before, also seem to happen later.

## Conclusion

In the first 15 seconds, confidence that commands are correct is very high, and with an error rate of 13.7% that seems to be correct. After that however, as the user exhaust their options, confidence drops and the amount of guesses drops as well, and with an error rate of 69.5% that is a sensible option to take.

Perceived confidence seems to be a strong indicator for making more attempts, dispite the error rate being similar. This can be observed in the first few seconds of attempts which holds most of the correct answers, as well as the case where the perceived confidence level was high. This means we should design our commands to increase the perceived confidence in order to make them used more.

Confidence also seems to affect speed in which commands are said in sequence, as they average time between commands seems to trend downward for high perceived confidence. Combination words have an effect of trending faster as well, perhaps because the first word has a lot of confidence of being correct. We can use this statistic as an analogy for remembering commands, although this admittedly is more of the author wanting to have some way of quantifying this statistic that is inheritly hard to measure in the true sense of the word.

Because all types of errors aside from duplicates would cause an issue in a voice command set, it makes sense to design a system where making these errors either pays off for the user by not actually causing an error, or where making an error is actively discouraged. The latter road however makes the user use voice control less, as exploring around by guessing is discouraged.

## Recommendations

As for these results being useful for designing voice commands, I would recommend the first word of a command to be a context noun, as they have, along with the initial word of combination words, the most retention rate. Verbs should be placed afterwards. This means an SVO ( Subject verb object ) structure would be optimal to pick.

Because this research has only been executed by a single person, results will vary depending on other people. As such, doing the research for yourself using the above lists would be a good addition. 

On top of that, this research only aims to answer the order of subject and verbs, but leaves out objects. Perhaps SOV carries more retention than SVO, but because sometimes a verb does not have an object to attach to, and I didn't want to make this research longer for myself, I left out that question.
