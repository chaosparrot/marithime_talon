# Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction, were at home;
# wherein the gods had ordained that he should return home to Ithaca;
# Then among them the father of gods and men began to speak;
# Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods;'
# For of us they say comes evil;
# whereas they even of themselves, through the blindness of their own hearts;
# have sorrows beyond that which is ordained;
# the slayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor woo his wife;'
# For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at the hand of Orestes;
# for all his good will, but now hath he paid one price for all;
# As for thee, thine heart regardeth it not at all, Olympian;
# And Zeus the cloud-gatherer answered her;
# My child, what word hath escaped the door of thy lips;
# But come, let us here one and all take good counsel as touching his returning;
# She spake and bound beneath her feet her lovely golden sandals that wax not old;
# And godlike Telemachus was far the first to descry her;
# Hail, stranger, with us thou shalt be kindly entreated;
# And when they were now within the lofty house;
# Then a handmaid bare water for the washing of hands in a goodly golden ewer;
# Dear stranger, wilt thou of a truth be wroth at the word that I shall say;
# Gone is the day of his returning;
# sailing over the wine-dark sea, unto men of strange speech;
# For goodly Odysseus hath not yet perished on the earth;
# O that I had been the son of some blessed man, whom old age overtook among his own possessions;
# Hold me now no longer, that am eager for the way;
# But whatsoever gift thine heart shall bid thee give me;
# and like an eagle of the sea she flew away;
# but in his spirit she planted might and courage';
# and put him in mind of his father yet more than heretofore;
# And he marked the thing and was amazed,;
# Now the renowned minstrel was singing to the wooers;
# And from her upper chamber the daughter of Icarius;
# Phemius, since thou knowest many other charms for mortals
# why then dost thou grudge the sweet minstrel to gladden us as his spirit moves him;'
# It is not minstrels who are in fault, but Zeus, methinks;
# As for him it is no blame if he sings the ill-faring of the Danaans;
# for not Odysseus only lost in Troy the day of his returning;
# let us feast now and make merry and let there be no brawling;
# and all that heard him bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus;
# in very truth the gods themselves instruct thee to be proud of speech;
# Never may Cronion make thee king in seagirt Ithaca;
# which thing is of inheritance thy right;
# wilt thou indeed be wroth at the word that I shall say;
# Yea, at the hand of Zeus would I be fain to take even this thing upon me;'
# Sayest thou that this is the worst hap that can befal a man;
# Telemachus complains in vain, and borrowing a ship;
# Now so soon as early dawn shone forth;
# and skilled in things past number;
# seeing that a mighty woe is rolling upon them;
# Go now, old man, get thee home and prophesy to thine own children;
# Howbeit there be many birds that fly to and fro under the suns rays,;
# He spake and snatched his hand from out the hand of Antinous;
# Mother, come draw off for me sweet wine in jars;
# So fill twelve jars, and close each with his lid;
# Now the sun arose and left the lovely mere, speeding to the brazen heaven;
# And they came to the gathering and the session of the men of Pylos;'
# Now is the better time to enquire and ask of the strangers who they are;
# now that they have had their delight of food;
# On some trading enterprise, or at adventure do ye rove;
# We have come forth out of Ithaca that is below Neïon;
# I follow after the far-spread rumour of my father;
# fought by thy side and sacked the city of the Trojans;
# we hear tidings, and where each one fell by a pitiful death;
# And speak me no soft words in ruth or pity;
# but tell me plainly what sight thou didst get of him;
# My friend, since thou hast brought sorrow back to mind;'
# this is the story of the woe which we endured in that land;
# who of mortal men could tell the tale;
# Nay none, though thou wert to abide here for five years;
# Old man, in no wise methinks shall this word be accomplished;
# Thus he spake, and the sun went down and darkness came on;
# And the henchmen poured water over their hands;
# and pages crowned the mixing bowls with drink;
# and they cast the tongues upon the fire,;
# and stood up and poured the drink-offering thereon;
# But when they had poured forth and had drunken to their heart’s content;
# Thus he spake and lo, they all hastened to the work;
# And now they lifted the victim’s head from the wide-wayed earth;
# But when they had put from them the desire of meat and drink;
# And the dame that kept the stores placed therein corn and wine and dainties;
# And forth they drave from the gateway and the echoing gallery;
# where Menelaus tells him what befell many of the Greeks on their return;
