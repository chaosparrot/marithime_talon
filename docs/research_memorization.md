# Memorization performance ( speed + errors )

In order to better understand what kinds of words are easier to remember, I have made lists of 12 words that I needed to remember a day after compiling them in order to test my long term memory. The performance is given in time and accuracy. 

Six lists were made for different types, combinations and sorting of words. No context is given at the start of the list, only the title of the list ( verb, context noun ) and a recording is made of me reciting the commands that I remembered within a single minute time frame. Performance is measured in amount of commands remembered and misremembered, and a list of seconds in between commands.

The first recording was made right after compiling the lists, so some short term memory effect still lingers. Rehearsing was done after the first recording by saying the lists out loud 3 times. The second recording will be made the next day.
