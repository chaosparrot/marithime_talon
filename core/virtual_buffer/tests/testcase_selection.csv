# We have come forth out of Ithaca that is below Neïon;
# I follow after the far-spread rumour of my father;
# fought by thy side and sacked the city of the Trojans;
# we hear tidings, and where each one fell by a pitiful death;
# And speak me no soft words in ruth or pity;
# but tell me plainly what sight thou didst get of him;
# My friend, since thou hast brought sorrow back to mind;'
# this is the story of the woe which we endured in that land;
# who of mortal men could tell the tale;
# Nay none, though thou wert to abide here for five years;
# Old man, in no wise methinks shall this word be accomplished;
# Thus he spake, and the sun went down and darkness came on;
# And the henchmen poured water over their hands;
# and pages crowned the mixing bowls with drink;
# and they cast the tongues upon the fire,;
# and stood up and poured the drink-offering thereon;
# But when they had poured forth and had drunken to their heart’s content;
# Thus he spake and lo, they all hastened to the work;
# And now they lifted the victim’s head from the wide-wayed earth;
# But when they had put from them the desire of meat and drink;
# And the dame that kept the stores placed therein corn and wine and dainties;
# And forth they drave from the gateway and the echoing gallery;
# where Menelaus tells him what befell many of the Greeks on their return;
